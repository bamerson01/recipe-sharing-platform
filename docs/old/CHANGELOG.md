## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Follow system with social networking features
- Interaction tracking pages (likes, comments, followers, following)
- Dashboard UX refresh with clickable stat cards
- Comprehensive database documentation system

### Changed
- Database column renamed: `following_id` ‚Üí `followed_id` in follows table
- Documentation restructured for better maintainability

### Fixed
- Database relationship errors in follows system
- RLS policy syntax for INSERT operations
- **Column Naming Inconsistency**: Fixed `src/app/api/feed/following/route.ts` to use `followed_id` instead of `following_id` for consistency with database schema
- **Foreign Key Constraint Issues**: Resolved data loading failures on interaction and connection pages by implementing manual joins instead of relying on Supabase's automatic foreign key relationships
  - Fixed `/interactions/likes` page data loading
  - Fixed `/interactions/comments` page data loading  
  - Fixed `/connections/followers` page data loading
  - Fixed `/connections/following` page data loading
- **Server Actions**: Updated `getFollowers`, `getFollowing`, `getWhoLikedMyRecipes`, and `getWhoCommentedOnMyRecipes` to use manual data fetching instead of nested Supabase queries
- **Data Transformation**: Implemented efficient two-step data fetching with Map-based lookups for better performance

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Supabase schema cache not recognizing foreign key constraints for `follows` and `likes` tables, despite constraints existing in database
- **Solution**: Replaced automatic foreign key joins with manual data fetching:
  1. Fetch relationship data (follows, likes, comments)
  2. Extract related IDs (follower_id, user_id, recipe_id)
  3. Fetch related data (profiles, recipes) using IN clauses
  4. Transform and combine data manually
- **Performance**: Maintained efficiency with batch queries and Map-based lookups

### Files Modified
- `src/app/_actions/manage-follows.ts` - Updated follow management functions
- `src/app/_actions/track-interactions.ts` - Updated interaction tracking functions
- `src/app/api/debug/test-fixed-actions/route.ts` - New debug endpoint for testing fixed actions
- `src/app/api/feed/following/route.ts` - Fixed column name from `following_id` to `followed_id`
