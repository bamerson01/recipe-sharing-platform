- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Search Optimization**: Full-text search with proper indexing

---

## üêõ **Major Bug Fixes & Debugging**

### **Foreign Key Constraint Issues & Manual Join Solution**
*Issue: Interaction and connection pages failing to load data*

**Root Cause**: Supabase schema cache not recognizing foreign key constraints for `follows` and `likes` tables, despite constraints existing in database
**Solution**: Implemented manual joins approach instead of automatic foreign key relationships
- Replaced nested Supabase queries with two-step data fetching
- First: Fetch relationship data (follows, likes, comments)
- Second: Fetch related data (profiles, recipes) using `IN` clauses
- Implemented Map-based lookups for efficient data transformation

**Additional Fix**: Column naming inconsistency in API routes
- **Issue**: `src/app/api/feed/following/route.ts` was still referencing `following_id` instead of `followed_id`
- **Solution**: Updated all references to use the correct column name `followed_id`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/_actions/manage-follows.ts` - Updated follow management functions
- `src/app/_actions/track-interactions.ts` - Updated interaction tracking functions
- `src/app/api/debug/test-fixed-actions/route.ts` - New debug endpoint

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Immediate functionality without database fixes
- ‚úÖ More reliable than depending on schema cache
- ‚úÖ Better performance with batch queries
- ‚úÖ Full control over data fetching process

**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved - All interaction and connection pages now working

### **Profile Creation Issues**
*Issue: New users getting "profile not found" errors*

**Root Cause**: Database trigger for auto-profile creation wasn't working properly
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive profile creation system
- Created `handle_new_user()` database trigger
- Added `ensureProfile()` helper function
- Updated profile API to handle missing profiles gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/db/ensure-profile.ts`
- `src/app/api/profile/route.ts`
- Database triggers and functions

### **Image Display Problems**
*Issue: Recipe cover images not displaying throughout the app*

**Root Cause**: Mismatch between old `imagePath` API and new `cover_image_key` system
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive image system overhaul
- Created `imageSrcFromKey()` helper function
- Updated all components to use `cover_image_key` and `updated_at`
- Added Next.js image configuration for Supabase domains
- Implemented proper revalidation after image uploads

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/images/url.ts`
- `src/components/recipe-card-unified.tsx`
- `next.config.js`
- Multiple recipe display components

### **Hydration Mismatch Issues**
*Issue: "Ghost looking buttons" on initial load, resolved on refresh*

**Root Cause**: Next.js hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
**Solution**: Converted auth components to server-side rendering
- Made `main-nav.tsx` a server component
- Created server-side auth buttons
- Removed client-side auth state management
- Added proper loading skeletons

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/main-nav.tsx`
- `src/components/header-auth.tsx`
- `src/app/_actions/sign-out.ts`
- Removed client-side auth components

### **Database Column Mismatch**
*Issue: "column follows.followed_id does not exist" errors*

**Root Cause**: Database had `following_id` but code expected `followed_id`
**Solution**: Renamed database column to match code expectations
- Executed: `ALTER TABLE public.follows RENAME COLUMN following_id TO followed_id;`
- Updated database context documentation
- Verified all foreign key relationships

### **Infinite Re-render Loop**
*Issue: "Maximum update depth exceeded" on saved recipes page*

**Root Cause**: SearchFilters component rendered without necessary props
**Solution**: Removed SearchFilters from saved recipes page
- Eliminated unnecessary component rendering
- Fixed dependency array issues
- Simplified page structure

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions & Patterns**

### **Server-First Approach**
**Decision**: Prioritize server-side rendering (SSR) over client-side
**Rationale**: Better performance, SEO, and reduced client bundle size
**Implementation**: Default to server components, use client components only when necessary

### **Component Architecture**
**Pattern**: Server Components (default) + Client Components (when needed)
**Server Components**: Data fetching, static content, layout
**Client Components**: Interactive features, event handlers, state management

### **Database Design Principles**
**Approach**: Use PostgreSQL features effectively
**Features**: RLS policies, triggers, full-text search, proper indexing
**Security**: Row-level security on all tables, no service role in client code

### **State Management**
**Strategy**: Minimal client state, prefer server state and derived props
**Implementation**: Server actions for mutations, optimistic updates for UX
**Benefits**: Simpler debugging, better performance, reduced complexity

## üìä **Performance Improvements & Metrics**

### **Database Query Optimization**
- **Before**: Multiple queries per recipe (ingredients, steps, categories)
- **After**: Single optimized query with joins
- **Improvement**: ~80% reduction in database round trips

### **Page Load Performance**
- **Saved Page**: Converted to server component, eliminated loading flash
- **Dashboard**: Server-rendered with user stats, improved initial load
- **Search**: Server-side processing with proper indexing
