# Database Schema

## Overview

The RecipeNest platform uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase with comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies, triggers, and functions. The schema is designed for scalability, security, and performance with proper indexing and constraint management.

## Core Tables

### Users & Profiles

#### `profiles` Table
**Purpose**: Stores user profile information and social metrics

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.profiles (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  username text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name text,
  avatar_key text,
  bio text,
  follower_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  following_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Column Details**:
- `id`: Primary key, references Supabase auth.users table
- `username`: Unique identifier for URLs and mentions (e.g., `/u/username`)
- `display_name`: Human-readable name for UI display
- `avatar_key`: Storage key for profile picture in `avatars` bucket
- `bio`: User biography text (nullable)
- `follower_count`: Cached count of users following this profile
- `following_count`: Cached count of users this profile follows
- `created_at`: Profile creation timestamp
- `updated_at`: Last profile update timestamp

**Constraints**:
- Primary key on `id`
- Unique constraint on `username`
- Foreign key to `auth.users(id)` with CASCADE delete

**Indexes**:
- `idx_profiles_username` on `username` for fast username lookups
- `idx_profiles_created_at` on `created_at` for chronological sorting

**Business Logic**:
- Username must be unique across all users
- Follower/following counts are maintained by database triggers
- Avatar uploads automatically update `avatar_key` field

### Recipe Management

#### `recipes` Table
**Purpose**: Stores recipe metadata, content, and engagement metrics

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.recipes (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title text NOT NULL,
  slug text NOT NULL,
  summary text,
  cover_image_key text,
  is_public boolean DEFAULT false,
  like_count integer DEFAULT 0,
  search_vector tsvector,
  difficulty text CHECK (difficulty IN ('Easy', 'Medium', 'Hard')),
  prep_time integer CHECK (prep_time > 0),
  cook_time integer CHECK (cook_time > 0),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Column Details**:
- `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key for recipes

- `idx_recipes_created_at` on `created_at` for chronological sorting
- `idx_recipes_like_count` on `like_count` for popularity sorting
- `idx_recipes_is_public` on `is_public` for visibility filtering

**Business Logic**:
- Slug must be unique per author (enforced by application logic)
- Like count is maintained by database triggers
- Search vector is automatically updated via triggers
- Cover images are stored in `public-media` bucket

#### `recipe_ingredients` Table
**Purpose**: Stores structured ingredient lists for recipes

- Follower/following counts are maintained by database triggers

#### `likes` Table
**Purpose**: Tracks user likes on recipes for engagement metrics

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.likes (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  recipe_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES public.recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

**Business Logic**:
- Recipes can belong to multiple categories
- Categories can contain multiple recipes
- Deleting a recipe removes all category associations

### User Interactions

#### `recipe_comments` Table
**Purpose**: Stores user comments on recipes for community engagement

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.recipe_comments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  recipe_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES public.recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

- `idx_recipe_comments_parent_id` on `parent_id` for reply queries
- `idx_recipe_comments_created_at` on `created_at` for chronological sorting

**Business Logic**:
- Comments support nested replies via `parent_id`
- Edit tracking maintains comment history
- Like counts are maintained by database triggers
- Comments are public and visible to all users

## Foreign Key Relationships

### Primary Relationships

```
profiles (id) ←→ recipes (author_id)
profiles (id) ←→ follows (follower_id)
profiles (id) ←→ follows (followed_id)
profiles (id) ←→ likes (user_id)
profiles (id) ←→ saves (user_id)
profiles (id) ←→ recipe_comments (user_id)

recipes (id) ←→ recipe_ingredients (recipe_id)
recipes (id) ←→ recipe_steps (recipe_id)
recipes (id) ←→ likes (recipe_id)
recipes (id) ←→ saves (recipe_id)
recipes (id) ←→ recipe_comments (recipe_id)
recipes (id) ←→ recipe_categories (recipe_id)

categories (id) ←→ recipe_categories (category_id)

recipe_comments (id) ←→ recipe_comments (parent_id)
```

### Relationship Cardinality

- **One-to-Many**: Profile → Recipes, Profile → Comments, Recipe → Ingredients/Steps
- **Many-to-Many**: Recipes ↔ Categories (via recipe_categories)
- **Self-Referential**: Comments can have nested replies
- **Social**: Follows create bidirectional relationships between profiles

## Unique Constraints

### Business Logic Enforcement

1. **`profiles.username`**: Ensures unique usernames across the platform
2. **`follows(follower_id, followed_id)`**: Prevents duplicate follow relationships
3. **`likes(recipe_id, user_id)`**: Prevents users from liking the same recipe multiple times
4. **`saves(recipe_id, user_id)`**: Prevents duplicate saves of the same recipe
5. **`categories.slug`**: Ensures unique category URLs

### Constraint Reasoning

- **Username uniqueness**: Required for URL routing and user identification
- **Follow uniqueness**: Prevents spam and maintains clean social graphs
- **Like/Save uniqueness**: Prevents data duplication and maintains accurate counts
- **Category slug uniqueness**: Required for consistent URL structure

## Indexes & Performance

### Primary Indexes
- All primary keys automatically create clustered indexes
- Foreign keys create indexes for join performance
- Composite indexes support common query patterns

### Search Optimization
- **GIN index on `recipes.search_vector`**: Enables fast full-text search
- **B-tree indexes on timestamps**: Support chronological sorting and filtering
- **Hash indexes on boolean fields**: Optimize visibility filtering

### Query Performance Considerations
- **Recipe listing**: Optimized with indexes on `is_public`, `created_at`, `like_count`
- **User content**: Fast retrieval with indexes on `author_id`, `user_id`
- **Social queries**: Efficient with indexes on follow relationships and timestamps

## Migration History

### Major Schema Changes
