- **Database Schema**: Establishing proper table relationships and constraints

### Phase 2: Social Features - Likes System (2025-01-19)

#### Public Kudos Implementation
- **Database Schema**: `public.likes` table with recipe_id, user_id, created_at
- **RLS Policies**: Public read access, owner-only insert/delete
- **Trigger System**: Automatic maintenance of `recipes.like_count`
- **UI Components**: Heart icons with counts on recipe cards and detail pages

**Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- Likes table creation
CREATE TABLE public.likes (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  recipe_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES public.recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate likes
ALTER TABLE public.likes ADD CONSTRAINT likes_recipe_user_unique UNIQUE (recipe_id, user_id);
```

**Business Logic**:
- Users can only like a recipe once (enforced by unique constraint)
- Like counts are public and visible to all users
- Automatic count maintenance via database triggers
- Event propagation stopped on recipe cards to prevent conflicts

**UI/UX Decisions**:
- **Heart Icon**: Universal symbol for likes with clear visual feedback
- **Count Display**: Real-time like count updates
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with rollback on failure
- **Event Handling**: Proper event propagation management

### Phase 3: Social Features - Saves System (2025-01-20)

#### Private Bookmarks Implementation
- **Database Schema**: `public.saves` table for private recipe bookmarks
- **RLS Policies**: Owner-only read/insert/delete access
- **Server Actions**: `toggleSave(recipeId)` for save management
- **Dedicated Page**: `/saved` page for saved recipes with search/filtering

**Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- Saves table creation
CREATE TABLE public.saves (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  recipe_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES public.recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.recipes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate saves
ALTER TABLE public.saves ADD CONSTRAINT saves_recipe_user_unique UNIQUE (recipe_id, user_id);
```

**Business Logic**:
- Saves are completely private and only visible to the user who created them
- Users can only save a recipe once (enforced by unique constraint)
- Saves are not counted in public metrics
- Dashboard integration with "Recipes Saved" card

**UI/UX Decisions**:
- **Primary CTA**: Save button as main action on recipe detail pages
- **Secondary CTA**: Like button as secondary social interaction
- **Dashboard Integration**: Quick access to saved recipes
- **Search & Filtering**: Full recipe discovery capabilities on saved page

### Phase 4: Search & Filtering (2025-01-21)

#### Advanced Search Implementation
- **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL `tsvector` over title, summary, and ingredients
- **Category Filters**: Many-to-many relationship with recipe categories
- **Cursor Pagination**: Efficient pagination for large result sets
- **Explore Page Tabs**: Top (by like_count) and Newest sorting options

**Implementation Details**:
```sql
-- Search vector column addition
ALTER TABLE public.recipes ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;

-- GIN index for fast full-text search
CREATE INDEX idx_recipes_search_vector ON public.recipes USING GIN (search_vector);

-- Search vector update trigger
CREATE TRIGGER recipe_search_vector_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.recipes
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_search_vector();
```

**Search Features**:
- **Ingredient Search**: Users can search for recipes by ingredients
- **Weighted Results**: Title (A), summary (B), ingredients (C) weighting
- **Performance Optimization**: GIN indexes for sub-second search results
- **Category Integration**: Filter by multiple categories simultaneously

**UI/UX Decisions**:
- **Unified Search**: Single search interface across all recipe content
- **Real-time Results**: Instant search feedback as user types
- **Filter Combinations**: Multiple filter criteria can be applied together
- **Sorting Options**: Popularity and recency-based sorting

### Phase 5: Dashboard UX Refresh (2025-01-22)

#### Social Networking Features
- **Follow System**: User follow/unfollow relationships
- **Social Metrics**: Follower/following counts and engagement tracking
- **Activity Feeds**: Recent recipes from followed users
- **Interaction Tracking**: Comprehensive like and comment analytics

**Database Additions**:
```sql
-- Follows table for social relationships
CREATE TABLE public.follows (
  id bigint PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  follower_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  followed_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Unique constraint and self-follow prevention
ALTER TABLE public.follows ADD CONSTRAINT follows_follower_followed_unique UNIQUE (follower_id, followed_id);
ALTER TABLE public.follows ADD CONSTRAINT follows_no_self_follow CHECK (follower_id != followed_id);
```

**Dashboard Redesign**:
- **Stat Cards**: Clickable navigation to different sections
- **Social Context**: Followers/following counts and recent activity

- `/connections/followers`: Users following me
- `/connections/following`: Users I follow

### Phase 6: Database Schema Refinement (2025-01-22)

#### Column Naming Consistency
- **Issue Identified**: `follows` table had inconsistent column naming
- **Problem**: `following_id` vs `followed_id` naming confusion
- **Solution**: Standardized on `followed_id` for clarity

**Database Changes**:
```sql
-- Column rename for clarity
ALTER TABLE public.follows RENAME COLUMN following_id TO followed_id;
```

**Code Updates**:
- Updated all application code to use `followed_id`
- Fixed API routes and server actions
- Updated documentation to reflect consistent naming
- Verified foreign key relationships maintained

**Business Logic Clarification**:
- **follower_id**: User who is following (initiates the relationship)
- **followed_id**: User being followed (receives the relationship)
- **Semantic Clarity**: Better understanding of relationship direction

### Phase 7: Foreign Key Constraint Issues & Manual Join Solution (2025-01-22)

#### Problem Identification
- **Symptoms**: Interaction and connection pages failing to load data
- **Error Messages**: "Unable to load recipe likes", "Unable to load following"
- **Root Cause**: Supabase schema cache not recognizing foreign key relationships

**Investigation Process**:
1. **Debug API Routes**: Created multiple debug endpoints to isolate issues
2. **Database Verification**: Confirmed tables exist and have data
3. **Constraint Testing**: Tested various foreign key constraint names
4. **Schema Cache Analysis**: Identified Supabase schema cache limitations

**Debug Endpoints Created**:
- `/api/debug/test-tables`: Verify table existence and data counts
- `/api/debug/test-server-actions`: Test server action functionality
- `/api/debug/test-foreign-keys`: Test foreign key relationship detection
- `/api/debug/test-constraint-names`: Test different constraint naming variations

#### Solution Implementation
- **Manual Join Approach**: Implemented two-step data fetching process
- **Bypass Schema Cache**: Avoided Supabase's automatic join detection
- **Efficient Queries**: Used IN clauses for batch data retrieval
- **Data Transformation**: Manual mapping of related data

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Fetch relationship data
const { data: follows } = await supabase
  .from('follows')
  .select('id, created_at, followed_id')
  .eq('follower_id', userId);

// 2. Extract related IDs
const followedIds = follows.map(f => f.followed_id);

// 3. Fetch related data using IN clause
const { data: profiles } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('id, username, display_name, avatar_key')
  .in('id', followedIds);

// 4. Transform with Map-based lookup
const profileMap = new Map(profiles?.map(p => [p.id, p]) || []);
const transformedData = follows.map(follow => ({
  ...profileMap.get(follow.followed_id),
  followed_at: follow.created_at
}));
```

**Benefits of Manual Joins**:
- **Reliability**: Works regardless of schema cache issues
- **Performance**: Batch queries with efficient IN clauses
- **Control**: Full control over data transformation
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot and optimize

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/_actions/manage-follows.ts`: Updated `getFollowers` and `getFollowing`
- `src/app/_actions/track-interactions.ts`: Updated `getWhoLikedMyRecipes` and `getWhoCommentedOnMyRecipes`

### Phase 8: Documentation Restructuring (2025-01-22)
