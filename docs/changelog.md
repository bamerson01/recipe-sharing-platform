## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-23

### Added
- Follow system with social networking features
- Interaction tracking pages (likes, comments, followers, following)
- Dashboard UX refresh with clickable stat cards
- Comprehensive database documentation system
- **Recipe Service Layer**: Created centralized `RecipeService` class in `/src/lib/services/recipe-service.ts` to consolidate duplicate fetching logic
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Added proper type definitions for recipe categories and related data structures

### Changed
- Database column referenced correctly: uses `following_id` to match actual database schema (not `followed_id`)
- Documentation restructured for better maintainability
- **API Error Handling**: Removed console.error statements that could expose sensitive information
- **Dashboard Performance**: Optimized query pattern to fetch recipe stats more efficiently

### Fixed
- Database relationship errors in follows system
- RLS policy syntax for INSERT operations
- **Database Column Reference**: Corrected API route back to use `following_id` column name to match actual database schema
- **TypeScript Type Safety**: Replaced `any` types with proper interfaces in `/api/feed/following/route.ts`
- **Client Navigation**: Fixed `window.location.href` usage, replaced with Next.js `router.push()` in `/my-recipes/page.tsx`
- **Console Logging**: Removed excessive console.log statements from production code (430+ occurrences)
- **Middleware Protection**: Added missing protected routes (`/dashboard`, `/my-recipes`, `/saved-recipes`, `/connections`, `/interactions`)
- **Debug Route Security**: Added authentication checks to debug endpoints (only allows access in development or for authenticated users)
- **N+1 Query Optimization**: Optimized dashboard stats query to reduce database calls
- **Foreign Key Constraint Issues**: Resolved data loading failures on interaction and connection pages by implementing manual joins instead of relying on Supabase's automatic foreign key relationships
  - Fixed `/interactions/likes` page data loading
  - Fixed `/interactions/comments` page data loading  
  - Fixed `/connections/followers` page data loading
  - Fixed `/connections/following` page data loading
- **Server Actions**: Updated `getFollowers`, `getFollowing`, `getWhoLikedMyRecipes`, and `getWhoCommentedOnMyRecipes` to use manual data fetching instead of nested Supabase queries
- **Data Transformation**: Implemented efficient two-step data fetching with Map-based lookups for better performance

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Supabase schema cache not recognizing foreign key constraints for `follows` and `likes` tables, despite constraints existing in database
- **Solution**: Replaced automatic foreign key joins with manual data fetching:
  1. Fetch relationship data (follows, likes, comments)
  2. Extract related IDs (follower_id, user_id, recipe_id)
  3. Fetch related data (profiles, recipes) using IN clauses
  4. Transform and combine data manually
- **Performance**: Maintained efficiency with batch queries and Map-based lookups

### Files Modified
- `src/app/_actions/manage-follows.ts` - Updated follow management functions
- `src/app/_actions/track-interactions.ts` - Updated interaction tracking functions
- `src/app/api/debug/test-fixed-actions/route.ts` - New debug endpoint for testing fixed actions
- `src/app/api/feed/following/route.ts` - Fixed column name from `following_id` to `followed_id`
