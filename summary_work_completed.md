# Summary of Work Completed

## Maintenance

### Header Alignment Standardization
- **Changed:** Header alignment standardized with Tailwind container/spacing
- **Reason:** Remove asymmetric padding and ensure consistency
- **Implementation:**
  - Replaced Tailwind `container` with `mx-auto max-w-screen-xl` for consistent max width
  - Applied responsive padding: `px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
  - Used `gap-x-6` for consistent spacing between clusters
  - Removed all child-level margins/paddings (mr-8, pl-4, etc.)
  - Auth buttons use `gap-x-4` for consistent internal spacing
  - Nav hidden on mobile with `hidden md:flex`

### Header Auth Buttons Server Rendering
- **Changed:** Header auth buttons now server-rendered; removed client wrappers and global CSS overrides
- **Reason:** Eliminates FOUC/hydration mismatch by deriving auth state on server
- **Files Modified:**
  - Created `/src/app/_actions/sign-out.ts` - Server action for sign out
  - Created `/src/components/header-auth.tsx` - Pure server auth component
  - Updated `/src/components/main-nav.tsx` - Now server component with server auth
  - Removed `/src/components/auth-buttons.tsx` - Client component no longer needed
  - Removed `/src/components/user-nav.tsx` - Client component no longer needed
  - Cleaned `/src/app/globals.css` - Removed CSS hacks for button rendering
  - Updated `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed suppressHydrationWarning

### Unified Recipe UI and Canonical URLs
- **Changed:** Unified recipe card & modal; standardized data shapes
- **Changed:** Canonical recipe URLs `/r/[id]-[slug]` + redirect on mismatch
- **Reason:** Remove redundancy, ensure consistent UX, guarantee stable links when titles change
- **Files Created:**
  - `/src/types/recipe.ts` - Standardized data contracts (RecipeSummary, RecipeFull)
  - `/src/lib/urls.ts` - Canonical URL helpers
  - `/src/components/recipe-card-unified.tsx` - Single unified recipe card
  - `/src/components/recipe-detail-modal-unified.tsx` - Single unified modal
  - `/src/components/recipe-grid-unified.tsx` - Unified grid with modal
  - `/src/app/api/recipes/[id]/route.ts` - API endpoint for full recipe details
  - `/src/app/r/[id-slug]/page.tsx` - Recipe detail page with canonical redirect
  - `/src/app/recipes/_actions/fetch-recipes-unified.ts` - Unified data fetching
- **Files Removed:**
  - `/src/components/recipe-card.tsx` - Replaced with unified version
  - `/src/components/recipe-detail-modal.tsx` - Replaced with unified version
  - `/src/components/recipe-grid.tsx` - Replaced with unified version
  - `/src/app/r/[slug]/` - Replaced with canonical [id-slug] route
- **Key Features:**
  - Single RecipeCard powers all views (Explore, Profile, My Recipes) with owner variant
  - Single RecipeDetailModal used everywhere with lazy loading by ID
  - Author links always navigate to profile, never trigger modal
  - Like/Save buttons don't trigger modal navigation
  - Canonical URLs ensure stable links even when recipe titles change
  - Lists return RecipeSummary shape, detail/modal fetches RecipeFull
