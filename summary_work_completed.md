- **ULID Keys** - Unique, sortable identifiers for all uploaded files
- **Scalable Design** - Ready for multi-image recipes and user-submitted photos

### **Database Schema Updates** ✅
- **Profiles Table** - Changed `avatar_url` to `avatar_key` for storage keys
- **Recipes Table** - Changed `image_path` to `cover_image_key` for storage keys
- **New Tables** - Added `recipe_images`, `recipe_comments`, `recipe_comment_images`
- **RLS Policies** - Comprehensive security policies for all new tables

### **Code Updates** ✅
- **Storage Utilities** - New `src/lib/storage.ts` with key building functions
