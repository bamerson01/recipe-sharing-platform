# Summary of Work Completed

## 2025-01-23 14:00 (America/Denver) — Code Quality & Security Improvements

**Scope:** bugfix/refactor
**Files:** 
- `src/app/api/feed/following/route.ts`
- `src/app/my-recipes/page.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/middleware.ts`
- `src/app/api/debug/test-tables/route.ts`
- `src/lib/services/recipe-service.ts` (new)

**Why:** QA review identified critical security, performance, and code quality issues

**What changed:**
- Fixed database column reference to use correct `following_id` name
- Removed 430+ console.log statements from production code
- Replaced `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Fixed client navigation using Next.js router instead of window.location
- Protected debug routes with authentication checks
- Added missing routes to middleware protection list
- Optimized N+1 query in dashboard stats
- Created centralized RecipeService for recipe operations

**Testing:** manual; local dev environment
**Impact:** Security, Performance, Code Quality

### PRD Variance
- NEW FEATURE: RecipeService layer — Added service abstraction layer for recipe operations to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability
- CHANGED FEATURE: Debug endpoints — Added authentication requirement in production environment for security (not specified in PRD)
